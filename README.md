# Shell

## Custom shell written in C
This project is to create a terminal from scratch in C and add all functionality required.

## Current functionality:
Currently this shell supports built-ins, piping, background processes, a colored terminal, and custom handling of command history, jobs, fg, bg, cd, and exit. I/O redirection has been added.

## Use
In order to use this project, clone shell.c using "git clone https://github.com/m-olive/shell.git " (without the quotes) into the desired directory. Then run "gcc shell.c -o shell && ./shell" without the quotes.
